Test firmware for transmit and receive for TWAI communication between two ESP32-S3 microcontrollers. 

One controller has a button which, when pressed, sends a TWAI message to the other controller and changes the color on an RGB led. The button will cycle between sending RED, GREEN, and BLUE.

Both firmwares were built using the ESP-IDF framework and PlatformIO extension in Visual Studio Code.
